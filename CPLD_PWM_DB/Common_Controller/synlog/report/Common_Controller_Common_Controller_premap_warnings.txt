@W: MT462 :"c:\users\yjhxfy\google drive\mmc\hardware\board\code\cpld\cpld_pwm_db\cc_protection.vhd":44:19:44:40|Net PROTECTION.ST_LATCH_TRIG appears to be an unidentified clock source. Assuming default frequency. 
@W: MT531 :"c:\users\yjhxfy\google drive\mmc\hardware\board\code\cpld\cpld_pwm_db\cc_protection.vhd":50:2:50:3|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 1 sequential elements including PROTECTION.ERR_LATCH.  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance. 
@W: MT529 :"c:\users\yjhxfy\google drive\mmc\hardware\board\code\cpld\cpld_pwm_db\cc_deadtime.vhd":41:2:41:3|Found inferred clock CC_PLL|CLKOP_inferred_clock which controls 288 sequential elements including CPWMA1.TIME_SET_2[6:0]. This clock has no specified timing constraint which may prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and may adversely impact design performance.
