@W: MT531 :"c:\users\wangq\desktop\utas_multi_source\hardware\cpld\cpld_mb_105_for_interleaved_vienna\cc_protection.vhd":50:2:50:3|Found signal identified as System clock which controls 2 sequential elements including PROTECTION.ERR_LATCH.  Using this clock, which has no specified timing constraint, can prevent conversion of gated or generated clocks and can adversely impact design performance.
